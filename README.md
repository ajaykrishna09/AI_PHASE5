## Overview

This project is a data-driven exploration and prediction tool that leverages AI to analyze and forecast trends in company registrations based on data from the Register of Companies (ROC). It provides insights and predictions that can be valuable for business planning, market analysis, and more.

## Features

- Data collection from ROC and other relevant sources.
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Machine learning models for trend analysis and prediction.
- Visualization tools for presenting results.
- User-friendly interface for interacting with the system.

## Requirements

List the software and hardware requirements for running the project. For example:
- Python 3.7+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- A machine with sufficient computational resources (CPU, RAM, etc.)

## Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the project. Include any prerequisites, virtual environment creation, and installation of necessary libraries. For example:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roc-analysis.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the project folder:
   ```
   cd roc-analysis
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS and Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Explain how to use the project. Provide examples, command-line instructions, and any necessary configuration settings. For instance:

1. Run the data collection script to gather ROC data:
   ```
   python data_collection.py
   ```

2. Preprocess the data using the preprocessing script:
   ```
   python data_preprocessing.py
   ```

3. Train the AI models for trend analysis:
   ```
   python train_models.py
   ```

4. Run the web-based interface to explore trends and predictions:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## Data Sources

Detail the data sources used in the project and how to access them. For example:

- Register of Companies (ROC): Provide a link or instructions on how to obtain ROC data.
- Additional datasets (if any): Specify sources and availability.

## Contributing

Explain how others can contribute to the project. Include guidelines for submitting issues, pull requests, and code contributions.

## License

Specify the project's license. For example, if you're using an open-source license like MIT:
